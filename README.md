### React

- In order to implement a responsive, single-page application capable of dynamically rendering with third-party API data, we utilized React Context and Hooks.

### Nodejs

- Despite being a front-end capstone that explicitly placed back-end implementation out of scope, used Nodejs to utilize Express.

### Express

- Simplified API requests by implementing a proxy server in Express.js that adds authentication while forwarding requests to an existing RESTful API.

### CSS

- Aside from being the sole technology used for the aesthetic styling of this application:
  - All styling, including functional implementations like the modals and image gallery, were written solely with CSS.
  - The use of Grid made the overlay button functionality and precise placement of static assets accessible and simple.
  - Flexbox was instrumental in handling the wealth of dynamic data being delivered to the page.

### Jest

- Each of the 4 contributors took independent ownership over the development of each module present in the application, which introduced the need for rigorous, automated testing.
- React Testing Library kept our efforts and tests focused on the user experience while making it possible to test the vast amount of interactions and dynamic components in our application.

![Webpack](https://img.shields.io/badge/webpack-%238DD6F9.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=webpack&logoColor=black)

### Webpack

- Webpack was our solution to elegantly handle our numerous static assets, implement JSX, and harness ES6 in this project.
